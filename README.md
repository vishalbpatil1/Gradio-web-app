What is Gradio?
Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows you to build a user interface for machine learning models and deploy it in a few lines of code. If you worked with Dash or Streamlit in python before, it’s similar; however, it integrates directly with notebooks and doesn’t require a separate python script.
Gradio can be installed directly through pip. Creating a Gradio interface only requires adding a couple lines of code to your project. You can choose from a variety of interface types to interface your function.
